**Overview**
As we age, every decade a man will lose ten pounds of muscle. They begin to shrink and lose mass. The number and size of muscle fibres also decrease. Handgrip strength drops, making it more difficult to do simple tasks like opening a jar. 
The heart muscle becomes less able to propel large quantities of blood quickly to the body. We tire more quickly and take longer to recover. The body's metabolic rate slows down, making it a lot easier to put on body fat. The mineral content of bones falls, so that bones become less dense and more fragile.
Build a Better Body after 50 gives users an opportunity to access information on resistance exercises that are relevant to person who is over 50 and who is looking to build and maintain muscle in order to create a strong healthy body as they age.
The website design is to be a simple and easy to use. It is primarily targeted towards an audience that has little experience of exercise or building muscle. It is free to use and publicly available. The user will need to sign up as a member in order to view and contribute to the pool of exercises.
