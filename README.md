# MS3-Body50+

**Body50+**

Backend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute.

The live website can be found []()

**Overview**

As we age, every decade a man will lose ten pounds of muscle. They begin to shrink and lose mass. The number and size of muscle fibres also decrease. Handgrip strength drops, making it more difficult to do simple tasks like opening a jar. The heart muscle becomes less able to propel large quantities of blood quickly to the body. We tire more quickly and take longer to recover. The body's metabolic rate slows down, making it a lot easier to put on body fat. The mineral content of bones falls, so that bones become less dense and more fragile.

Body50+ gives users an opportunity to access information on resistance exercises that are relevant to person who is over 50 and who is looking to build and maintain muscle in order to create a strong healthy body as they age.

The website design is to be a simple and easy to use. It is primarily targeted towards an audience that has little experience of exercise or building muscle. It is free to use and publicly available. The user will need to sign up as a member in order to view and contribute to the pool of exercises.

 ## UX Design
 
**Strategy**

*User Needs* - User to access the site on mobile, tablet and then the desktop. The information is to be presented in a concise manner.

*Technical Aptitudes* - The main technologies used in the project will be HTML, CSS, Materialize, Python+Flask and MongoDB

*Business Vision* - The project is not a commercial venture but simply to inform and educate the user.


**Scope**

For the audience I want to present a fun and enjoyable app that is easy to understand and can be accessed on mobile devices, laptops and desktops. If they find the content useful they might tell their friends.

**Structure**


**Skeleton**

*[Wireframes](https://github.com/BabusDublinCoding/MS2-And-The-Award-Goes-To/tree/master/wireframes)*

- The wireframes were created using Balsamic, a popular wireframing tool, which Code Institute student can avail of as a fully licenced product.
- This was done during the early stages of the project and demonstrates the structure of the website on different devices including mobile, tablet and desktop.



**Surface**

*Design*

**Colour Scheme**

Colours associated with exercise related websites tend to contain strong dark colours such as black contrasted with light greens and shades of white. There are often warmer colours added sparingly to add a sense sophistication. I have chosen a palette which reflects this, so the user feels a certain comfortable familiarity.

## Testing

## Deployment


Using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), I created Body50+ web application. Then, using Git commits I pushed the project to my GitHub repository. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used with the deployment of the live website. Connecting Gitpod / GitHub to Heroku meant that any git commits changes automatically updated the live site.
